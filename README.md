# Madlibz

The purpose of the website is to play mad libs. It also has Turkish and English language support. It can save your words by using local storage. For the first time, I did pair programming and worked on a project with a partner and it was my first ever vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS project. Also, it was the first time that I learned about and worked with regular expressions, i18next library, local storage. The style of the project was purely CSS. I didn't use any frameworks for styling.
